## Summary
The Kearl Fine Tailings Thickener (KFTT) is a critical piece of equipment at the Kearl oil sands facility.  Responsible for processing both flotation tailings (FT) and fluid fine tailings (FFT) the unit is comprised of 2 thickeners that receive inputs from both plants (K1/K2) and the barge at the tailings ponds.  The purpose of the thickener is to consolidate tailings for deposition in the tailings ponds.  In so doing the unit removes water and also skims bitumen off the surface for recycle back to K1/K2 extraction.  Ultimately the thickener is important because it reduces our reliance on fresh water as well as provides stable material for future use.

## Background
The Kearl Fine Tailings Treatment (KFTT) project involves two thickeners, a flocculant system and the associated pipe and pumping systems for the densification and disposition of fine flotation tailings that are recovered from the middling’s stream of the primary separation cells and fluid fine tails (FFT) that are recovered from the west external tailings area (WETA) at the Kearl Oil Sands (KOS) mine. 

At the Kearl Oil Sands mine, the oil sand ore is mined from the ground, crushed and mixed with water prior to sending the slurry down the hydrotransport line to the extraction plant.  The primary separation cell (PSC) recovers bitumen as froth from the conditioned oil sands slurry.  A side stream (PSC middlings) off of the PSC improves the recovery of bitumen by utilizing another separation step – flotation cells. This step also produces a second tailings stream (flotation). The two tailings streams, PSC and flotation, are comprised of three major components: water, sand (solid particles > 44 μm) and fines (solid particles < 44 μm).  

The KFTT thickens the fine flotation tailings stream recovered from the PSC middlings and the FFT recovered from the ETA and deposits the thickened underflow, along with the coarse sand tailings (CST), in an inter-bedded placement in the east half of the external tailings area (EETA) (a ‘dry’ tailings storage facility).  A barge facility to remove (FFT) from the WETA is also included.
